# Movie API

## Overview

Welcome to the Movie API repository! This project features a Java backend with Spring Boot, serving as the API for movie-related operations. The front end consists of two parts: an Astro Front-End using React for a dynamic user interface and a Create React App (CRA) Front-End for enhanced functionality.

## Java Backend

The Java backend is built with Spring Boot and uses MongoDB for data storage. It provides endpoints for managing movie-related information.

### Technologies Used

- **Java with Spring Boot**: Backend framework for building scalable APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing movie data.
- **Spring Data MongoDB**: Simplifies the interaction with MongoDB in the Spring application.
- **Lombok**: Enhances Java code readability by reducing boilerplate code.
- **Spring Dotenv**: Allows loading environment variables from a .env file.

## Astro and CRA FrontEnd

The front end is divided into two parts: an Astro Front-End and a CRA Front-End. The Astro Front-End utilizes the Astro framework, while the CRA Front-End is built with Create React App.

#### Technologies Used

- **Astro**: Modern framework for building static sites with dynamic rendering.
- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **Emotion**: CSS-in-JS library for styling.
- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for styling.
- **Material-UI**: React components for faster and easier web development.
